#+TITLE: Wine Ontology

This document describes the UC Davis Wine ontology.  The first item of business
is some standard prefixes for our ontology.  We will be using some owl
reasoning, so we include that.  We will also be comparing this to some dbpedia
objects as well, so those need to be included.

This ontology will be identified as the default ontology in this file.

#+END_SRC

OK, let's start with some of the most basic aspects of Wine. Here we will define
the Wine class, and identify is as being the same as some other examples,
dbpedia for example.

#+BEGIN_SRC :tangle wine-ontology.owl
:Wine a owl:Class;
= wd:Q282;
wdt:P646 <https://g.co/kg/m/081qc>.

# We also allow wine labels to be rdf labels
:label a owl:Class;
 = rdf:label.

#+END_SRC

We can first define wine by it's major type.  These divide still, sparkling and
fortified wines.  We also include dessert wines, since they are part of the US
wine type categories.  Note that the domain of this is supposed to verify that
we can only use that type from our list.

#+BEGIN_SRC n3 :tangle wine-ontology.owl
  :WineType a rdf:Class.

  :StillWine a :WineType;
  rdf:label "Still Wine"@en.

  :SparklingWine a :WineType;

  :DessertWine a :WineType;

  rdf:label :Dessert Wine"@en;

  = wdt:Q722338;
  rdf:label "Fortified Wine"@en.

  :type a rdf:Property;
  rdfs:domain :Wine;
  rdfs:range :WineType.

#+END_SRC

Wine can also be described by it's color.  Similar to the type, there is only a
limited number of these to choose from.

#+BEGIN_SRC n3 :tangle wine-ontology.owl
# We also have three Wine Colors
:WineColor a rdf:Class.

rdf:label "Rose".

:WhiteWine a :WineColor;
rdf:label "White"@en.

:color a rdf:Property;
rdfs:domain :Wine;
rdfs:range :WineColor.

#+END_SRC

Next, we have some other properties specific to a general wine.  These  include
the alcohol content, and the address of the winery.

#+BEGIN_SRC n3 :tangle wine-ontology.owl
:alcohol a rdf:Property;
         rdfs:domain :Wine;

** US Wines

Somewhere around 1978, we I need to check, new regulations came out in terms of
the types of infomation that could be included on a label.  These allow us to be
more specific with our descriptions of a wine, from investigation of the label.
Right now, I'm allowing some of these attributes to be used on general wine labels.

* Examples

Below are a few examples of some wine definitions.  We include a number of wine
labels from the Amarine collection, as well as an example from Opus One.

First, we need to define our prefixes.  Since are are

Sonoma Winery identified as a anonymous winery.   This is another method of

This is one of the earliest wines in the Amerine collection, pre-prohibition.  It
corresponds to [[https://labelthis.lib.ucdavis.edu/view/0162][Label 0162]].  In addition to the label, Ive taken some information

** Opus One

Our Opus One example has a number of vintages starting in 1979, of one of the
most famous wines from the United States.  Here, much of the information comes
from the website, in particular the vintage blends as it does from the the label
itself.  Also note that the vintage blends can take precedent over the label
constituents.

This example starts to examine the wine maker as well, though only briefly.
