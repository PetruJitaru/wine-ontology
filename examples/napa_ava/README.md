# Napa AVA Example

This is a simple example that will grow to demonstrate the ontology of the wines
at work with existing wines and wine labels.  Currently, these data have the
original naming scheme from Napa County, where the data was derived.

There are two main datasets, some Napa County AVAs and some wineries.  These are
some first pass data to bed used as a testbed for the ontology, as well as
giving some starting data for some GIS testing.
